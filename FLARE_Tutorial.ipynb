    "  * **Restart an active-learning**: to continue an interrupted or finished on-the-fly training.\n",
    "  * **Warm start**: start a new on-the-fly training from a previously trained SGP model.\n",
    "  * **Model instantiation parameter testing**: discuss testing static model parameters prior to training the final force field.\n",
    "  * **Offline training**: train the final force field \"offline\" using previously generated DFT training frames, without running MD. Also create files to be used for uncertainty quantification during production MD.\n"

    "# 5 Evaluate Model Instantiation Parameters\n",
    "Prior to the final training of any SGP model, the user should evaluate the model instantiation parameters, i.e., those parameters that are not optimized during training. These parameters build the descriptor representation of atomic environments in the FLARE framework, namely, the cutoff, n$_{max}$, and l$_{max}$. Here, we recommend using a bash script to build the directory structure, and tools like `sed` to easily replace strings of interest in the `yaml` files. We recommend the following ranges of parameters, which have found to be sufficient to scan for a variety of systems: cutoff = (3.0,9.0,1.0), n$_{max}$ = (2,14,2), and l$_{max}$ = (0,6,1). The highest marginal log likelihood, as well as the corresponding force, energy and stress MAEs, are all typically used to select the best model parameters, which can be parsed from the training files once completed. Since the number of force labels is highest, relative to energies and stresses, the force MAE is usually given the most weight in selecting the highest performance model. One should also keep in mind the total cost of the model when sweeping through model instantiation parameters, which grows with the dimension of the descriptor, and is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$n_d$ = ($n_{max}$ $\\cdot$ $n_{species}$ + 1) $\\cdot$ $n_{max}$ $\\cdot$ $\\frac{n_{species}}{2}$ $\\cdot$ ($l_{max}$ + 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then select appropriate model instantiation parameters that provide a minimum in the force MAE, while keeping the cost of the descriptor minimal. We can then perform another offline training on the entire dataset generated from our consecutive active-learning trajectories to yield the final FLARE potential. This is the final step in creating a FLARE potential for your workflow, where additional MD and uncertainty quantification steps can be found elsewhere.\n"

    "# 6 Validation and Test\n",
    "\n",
    "After a model is trained, we want to know the accuracy of the model. Notice that the mean absolute errors reported during the on-the-fly/offline training are not the real test error, since those are evaluated with the models at the current steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few approaches that we can use for testing the potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the LAMMPS coefficient file of the trained potential to run an MD with LAMMPS, and randomly pick up a few frames for DFT calculations. Then the error can be calculated by directly comparing the LAMMPS and DFT energy/forces/stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With extra AIMD data that are not used for training, there are two ways:\n",
    "  -  Warm start an offline training with a very large `std_tolerance_factor`, such that no frame will be added to the model during the offline training, but each frame will be predicted and the MAE will be computed.\n",
    "  - Use the [ASE LAMMPS Calculator](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/lammps.html) or the [LAMMPS Python API](https://docs.lammps.org/Python_head.html) and the coefficient file of FLARE potential to make predictions on the frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the MAE and make the parity plot as shown in [this example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VzbIPmx1z-uygKstOYTj2Nqr53AMC5NL#scrollTo=Plot_the_Predictions).\n"
